I can see you've been working on the macdefaultbrowser project and have made significant progress with versioning, code signing, notarization, and distribution setup. 

I notice from the recent build output that there are some deprecation warnings about Launch Services APIs:

```
'LSCopyAllHandlersForURLScheme' was deprecated in macOS 10.15: Use -[NSWorkspace URLsForApplicationsToOpenURL:] instead.
'LSCopyDefaultHandlerForURLScheme' was deprecated in macOS 10.15: Use -[NSWorkspace URLForApplicationToOpenURL:] instead.
```

What would you like me to help you with next? Some possibilities:

1. **Fix the deprecation warnings** - Update the Launch Services code to use the modern NSWorkspace APIs
2. **Continue with TODO items** - Work on remaining tasks like testing or documentation
3. **Review and optimize** - Look at the current implementation for improvements
4. **Something else** - Let me know what specific aspect you'd like to focus on

What would you like to work on?

I'll help you fix the deprecation warnings by updating the Launch Services code to use the modern NSWorkspace APIs. Let me start by examining the current implementation.
