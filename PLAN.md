# Comprehensive Improvement Plan for macdefaultbrowser

## Executive Summary

The `macdefaultbrowser` project is a well-structured Swift implementation of a macOS command-line tool for managing default browsers. The codebase demonstrates good architecture with separated concerns, modern Swift practices, and comprehensive build/distribution infrastructure. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance stability, elegance, and deployability.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct modules (BrowserManager, LaunchServicesWrapper, DialogAutomation)
2. **Modern Swift Practices**: Use of async/await, proper error handling, and Swift Package Manager
3. **Comprehensive Build System**: Makefile with versioning, code signing, notarization support
4. **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions for automated builds and releases
5. **Documentation**: Good README, code signing guide, and Homebrew documentation

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Test Coverage**: Limited test suite with only basic unit tests
2. **Error Handling**: Some error paths could be more graceful
3. **Performance**: Multiple Launch Services API calls could be optimized
4. **User Experience**: Limited feedback during operations
5. **Installation Process**: Homebrew tap not yet created
6. **Code Quality**: Some areas could benefit from refactoring

## Detailed Improvement Plan

### 1. Testing Infrastructure Enhancement

#### 1.1 Expand Unit Test Coverage
The current test suite only covers basic functionality in BrowserManagerTests. We need comprehensive testing for all components:

- **LaunchServicesWrapper Tests**: Mock the Launch Services API to test edge cases
- **DialogAutomation Tests**: Create tests for AppleScript generation and execution
- **Version Module Tests**: Verify version string formatting and git tag parsing
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test all error paths and recovery mechanisms

#### 1.2 Integration Testing
- Create integration tests that verify the complete workflow
- Test with different browser configurations (single browser, multiple browsers, no browsers)
- Verify dialog automation works correctly on different macOS versions
- Test upgrade scenarios to ensure backward compatibility

#### 1.3 Performance Testing
- Benchmark Launch Services API calls
- Measure dialog automation response times
- Profile memory usage during operations

### 2. Code Quality and Architecture Improvements

#### 2.1 Optimize Launch Services Integration
Currently, the code makes multiple calls to Launch Services APIs. We should:
- Cache browser information to reduce API calls
- Implement a single scan that retrieves all necessary information
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures

#### 2.2 Enhanced Error Handling
- Implement a comprehensive error hierarchy with specific error types
- Add recovery suggestions for common errors
- Provide detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting
- Add a `--verbose` flag for debugging

#### 2.3 Refactor Dialog Automation
The current implementation uses string-based AppleScript generation. Improvements:
- Create a type-safe AppleScript builder
- Add timeout handling with configurable values
- Implement fallback mechanisms if automation fails
- Add support for different dialog variations across macOS versions

### 3. User Experience Enhancements

#### 3.1 Progress Indicators
- Add visual feedback during browser scanning
- Show progress during dialog automation
- Provide clear success/failure messages

#### 3.2 Interactive Mode
- Add an interactive mode that guides users through browser selection
- Implement tab completion for browser names
- Add confirmation prompts for destructive operations

#### 3.3 Configuration File Support
- Allow users to save preferences in `~/.config/macdefaultbrowser/config.json`
- Support aliases for browser names
- Remember user preferences for dialog automation timing

### 4. Distribution and Installation Improvements

#### 4.1 Create Official Homebrew Tap
- Set up `homebrew-tap` repository
- Automate formula updates on new releases
- Add bottle generation for faster installation
- Submit to homebrew-core after stability testing

#### 4.2 Alternative Installation Methods
- Create a standalone installer package (.pkg) with GUI
- Add support for MacPorts
- Provide a curl-based installation script
- Create a Docker image for CI/CD environments

#### 4.3 Auto-update Mechanism
- Implement version checking against GitHub releases
- Add `--update` command to self-update
- Provide update notifications in terminal

### 5. Documentation and Developer Experience

#### 5.1 Comprehensive Documentation
- Create man page (`man macdefaultbrowser`)
- Add inline help with examples
- Create video tutorials for common use cases
- Document all environment variables and configuration options

#### 5.2 Developer Documentation
- Add architecture diagrams
- Document the Launch Services API usage
- Create contribution guidelines
- Add debugging guide for common issues

#### 5.3 API Documentation
- Generate documentation using DocC
- Host documentation on GitHub Pages
- Add code examples for each public API

### 6. Platform and Compatibility

#### 6.1 macOS Version Support
- Test and document compatibility with macOS 10.15 through latest
- Add version-specific workarounds where needed
- Implement graceful degradation for older systems

#### 6.2 Localization
- Add support for multiple languages
- Localize error messages and user prompts
- Support international browser names

### 7. Security and Privacy

#### 7.1 Security Hardening
- Implement input validation for all user inputs
- Add protection against command injection in AppleScript
- Verify browser bundle signatures before setting as default

#### 7.2 Privacy Considerations
- Add option to disable telemetry/analytics
- Document what system information is accessed
- Implement minimal permission requirements

### 8. Performance Optimizations

#### 8.1 Startup Time
- Profile and optimize cold start performance
- Lazy load components that aren't immediately needed
- Implement compilation optimizations

#### 8.2 Memory Usage
- Ensure proper cleanup of Core Foundation objects
- Optimize data structures for minimal memory footprint
- Add memory usage monitoring in verbose mode

### 9. Continuous Integration Improvements

#### 9.1 Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline
- Add matrix testing for multiple macOS versions
- Implement automated performance regression testing
- Add security scanning (SAST/DAST)
- Create automated release notes generation

#### 9.2 Release Process
- Implement semantic versioning automation
- Add changelog validation
- Create release candidate testing workflow
- Automate Homebrew formula updates

### 10. Future Features

#### 10.1 Advanced Browser Management
- Support for browser profiles/workspaces
- Integration with browser-specific features
- Support for PWA management
- Browser launch options configuration

#### 10.2 System Integration
- Create a menu bar application
- Add Shortcuts.app integration
- Support for automated workflows
- Integration with corporate management tools
