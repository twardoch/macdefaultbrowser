## Core Dialog Automation Logic

### System Dialog Confirmation
**Importance: 95**
- Location: `reference/good.sh`
- Automatically confirms system-level dialogs that appear when changing the default browser
- Eliminates requirement for manual user interaction during browser changes
- Integrates AppleScript to handle native macOS security prompts

### Dialog Integration Flow
**Importance: 85**
- Triggered when default browser change is initiated
- Waits for system dialog appearance
- Executes automated confirmation through AppleScript
- Ensures completion of browser change operation

### AppleScript Integration
**Importance: 80**
- Bridges gap between command-line tool and system UI interactions
- Handles native macOS security dialog automation
- Maintains security context while providing automated response

## Business Workflow

### Dialog Sequence
**Importance: 75**
- Automated response to system security prompts
- Sequential handling of confirmation dialogs
- Verification of successful dialog completion

## Validation Rules

### Dialog State Verification
**Importance: 70**
- Confirms presence of expected dialog before automation
- Validates successful dialog completion
- Ensures browser change is properly registered
