## Core Integration Components [Score: 95]

### Browser Discovery
- Queries Launch Services API to enumerate all HTTP/HTTPS handlers
- Extracts bundle identifiers (e.g. com.google.Chrome)
- Maps bundle IDs to human-readable browser names
- Maintains case-insensitive matching for browser names

### Default Browser Management [Score: 90]
- Identifies current default handler via Launch Services
- Sets new default browser for both HTTP/HTTPS schemes simultaneously
- Ensures scheme consistency across protocols
- Handles system confirmation dialogs automatically

## Domain-Specific Logic [Score: 85]

### Bundle Identifier Processing
- Custom transformation of bundle IDs to browser names
- Bi-directional mapping between IDs and display names
- Case-insensitive comparison for user input matching

### Protocol Handler Validation [Score: 80]
- Verifies handler availability for both HTTP/HTTPS schemes
- Confirms handler capabilities before allowing default status
- Maintains protocol handler consistency
